Node-RED and DuckDB have become an exceptional combination, allowing the use of quick coding techniques to configure, cache, and modify flows dynamically. This synergy facilitates a seamless transition from rapid prototyping to production, simplifying the development process. With AI snippets, you can also store WASM files generated by Go, Rust, C, C++, and more, adding a robust layer of functionality to your workflows. 

## Environment
- Node v20.12.1  
- Node-RED v3.8.1  
- Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS

Note: We could have configured DuckDB during the setup phase. However, unfortunately, this defaults to the latest version. To specify a version, we need to set it up in both `package.json` and `settings.js`.

```
npm install duckdb@0.10.1 --save
```
Done!

## Modify Your settings.js File

Step: 1 Add your favorite node package. For this example a simple word-to-number package will be used.
```
vi settings.js
```

Step 2: Restart node-red
You will now be able to use this package. 

Done!
